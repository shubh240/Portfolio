            I am a passionate developer with 1.8 years of experience in building scalable and efficient web applications. I started my career as an SQL Developer at <strong>Techsture Technologies</strong>, where I worked for 4 months. During my time there, I gained hands-on experience with database management and query optimization, which gave me a strong foundation in backend development.
            <br /><br />
            Afterward, I transitioned to a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> role at <strong>Hyperlink Infosystem</strong>, where Iâ€™ve spent 1.3 years working on diverse projects. I have developed expertise in building both frontend and backend systems using technologies such as <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, as well as handling relational databases like <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            At Hyperlink Infosystem, I worked on two live projects that helped me refine my skills. The first project was an <strong>online learning platform</strong>, where I was responsible for designing and implementing the frontend in React.js, ensuring a seamless user experience for learners and instructors. For the second project, a <strong>real estate platform</strong>, I worked on both the frontend and backend. I used React.js for the frontend, while Node.js powered the backend. This platform focused on buying, selling, and renting properties, and I also built an admin panel to manage listings and user activities.
            <br /><br />
            Throughout these experiences, I have learned to solve complex problems, implement scalable solutions, and create intuitive user interfaces. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and am always eager to learn new technologies and tools. My academic background includes a BE in Computer Engineering from <strong>Apollo Institute of Engineering and Technology</strong>, where I developed a strong foundation in software engineering principles.
            <br /><br />
            Currently based in <strong>Ahmedabad</strong>, I am constantly exploring ways to innovate and improve my skillset to stay at the forefront of the rapidly evolving tech industry.
